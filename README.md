## Quantum-Computing
#### Small Cirq simulator and inserting Strategies

`Cirq` has an inbuilt package for a simulator which simulates the quantum phenomenon and displays a 
corresponding output basic on the circuit provided. Over here, 2 QuBits are created which will then be 
used to form a `circuit` to be used in the ``simulator``.

There are different types of Insert Strategies which can be used to create a `Quantum Circuit` using Cirq. 
These insert strategies help in the execution of the circuit and also make the creation of new moments 
easier.
